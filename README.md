### Twitter Based Sentiment Analysis
What it does

    1. Pulls twitter and stock information
    1. Clusters tweets based on influence
    1. Builds both a unsupervised and supervised machine learning models with decent accuracy on validation sets
    1. Output dataset and model saved

How I built it

Using several data science libraries in python, pandas carried me through all the csv formatting


For future expansions of this project, I would like to vastly increase the size of the dataset used, experiment with other dimensions such as graph theory based evaluation of the network, explore using more than one social media source, and just play with this concept on a larger scale. Along with this combine the datasets from the other models .
